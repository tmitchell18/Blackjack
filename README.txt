*who you worked with and sources used

This assignment was very straight forward and went very smoothly. One of the issues I ran into was trying to figure out how to 
keep each card's value unique in order to print out its desired name while adding only 10 to the total when calculating the total
sum of the cards for face cards. I mended this by searching for those specific values in my sumCards() and adding only 10 when finding 
those specific cards.
